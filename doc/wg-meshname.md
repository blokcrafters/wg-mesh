### A WG-Mesh Mesh Config File
The mesh config file is handled using the python3 configparser module documented
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html).

Here is what a sample wg-mesh wg-\<meshname\>.ini file looks like:
```
[DEFAULT]
# A WG-Mesh Mesh Config File
# An interface setting is required.  A typical value is wg0 which will be the interface used by wireguard.
# It can be any interface name you would like to use and does not have to contain digit.
interface=myvpn
# nodes contains the list of nodes in this wireguard mesh network.
# Each node in the nodes list must have a .ini file for it with at least an inet4address or inet6address in it.
# Other values in the node.ini file will be auto-generated and the file re-written when needed.
# Using the following value for nodes - the files node1.ini, node2.ini, and node3.ini will be required to exist
nodes = node1, node2, node3, node4
# listenport is used for a node when it needs a listenport and one is not specified in it's node.ini file
listenport = 24825
# network4 if present must be a private network
# network6 if present must be a private network
network4 = 10.0.0.0/8
network6 = fd86:ea04:1115::/64
# startaddress4 if present must be in network4
# startaddress6 if present must be in network6
startaddress4 = 10.0.0.1
startaddress6 = fd86:ea04:1115::1
# preferredendpoints if present must be either ipv4 or ipv6
preferredendpoints = ipv4
```
The settings for interface and nodes are required.
The interface value should be an interface name that does not already exist - unless you are simply adding new nodes
to this particular mesh network.
Some typical settings might be: wg0, myvpn, wg1, home, planets.

The rest of the settings are used on an as needed basis and may or may not be required.
For example, if a node does not have a wg4address and needs to have one generated for it - then the network4 value
along with the startaddress4 value from the mesh config file will be used to generate a wg4address for the node.
My recommendation is to set all possible values in the mesh config file and let the nodes have their settings
auto-generated by wg-mesh.
